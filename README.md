## dotfiles

Here you will find all my dotfiles (configuration files, scripts, etc.). Files and scripts placed on the **Windows** folder are, well, for a windows setup. Everything else is for Linux.

### Permission denied

If you get this error, just do the following:

```bash
cd ..
chmod -R u+x+r dotfiles
```
